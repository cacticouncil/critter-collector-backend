      summary: Checks if a regular spawner is near player's location.
      description: Looks for regular spawners near a player's location. This request should be 
                   used when a player is not within the boundaries of a special location. 
                   <br /><br />If any regular spawners are found nearby, an array of spawners will 
                   be returned. These spawners can be used to spawn new animals near the player. 
                   <br /><br />If no regular spawners are found nearby, a POST request should be 
                   made to create a new regular spawner at the player's current location.
