      summary: Checks if a special spawner is near player's location.
      description: Looks for special spawners near a player's location. This request should be 
                   used when a player is within the boundaries of a special location. 
                   <br /><br />If any special spawners are found nearby, an array of spawners will 
                   be returned. These special spawners can be used to spawn new animals near the player.
                   <br /><br />If no special spawners are found nearby, a POST request should be 
                   made to create a new special spawner at the player's current location.
